            What's a 'Makeathon?'
        </h1>

         <p>
            Challenge yourself to brainstorm, create, and showcase a project based on a given theme in 36 hours! Although this concept
            comes from Hackathons and Game Jams, which are computer-science-focused events, in the Hampshire tradition our 'Makeathon' is interdisciplinary, meaning 
            any project—dance, film, writing, coding, math, art, music, etc.—is welcome, as long as it addresses the theme in some way, 
            and is able to be showcased.  <br> <br>
            
            Fellow students, community members, and professors will be available to help you troubleshoot, work through 
            writer's block, or even just to be a second set of eyes. (If you're excited about participating, feel free to reach
            out to your favorite professors!) <br> <br>

            We reccomend (although it's not required) that you work in teams, but don't worry if you're not sure who to work with! There
            will be team-building sessions to help match participants with similar interests/goals before time starts. <br> <br>

            There will also be food and goodies throughout the weekend to keep everyone fueled and motivated! <br> <br>

            If you are interested in participating, volunteering, or donating, stay tuned! Sign-ups will be posted to this site soon.
